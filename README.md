# Machine_learning
Machine learning is a subfield of **artificial intelligence** that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task over time ยน. It is an umbrella term for solving problems for which development of algorithms by human programmers would be cost-prohibitive, and instead the problems are solved by helping machines 'discover' their 'own' algorithms, without needing to be explicitly told what to do by any human-developed algorithms . 

Machine learning has been applied to a wide range of fields, including **computer vision**, **speech recognition**, **email filtering**, **agriculture** and **medicine** ยน. The mathematical foundations of machine learning are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods .
