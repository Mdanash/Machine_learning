# Machine Learning in Python

This repository is your guide to getting started with machine learning in Python. Here are some key points:

1. **Why Python for Machine Learning**: Python is a popular choice for ML due to its simplicity and a vast ecosystem of libraries.

2. **Libraries for Machine Learning**: Essential libraries include:
   - NumPy: For numerical operations.
   - Pandas: For data manipulation.
   - Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms.
   - TensorFlow & PyTorch: For deep learning.

3. **Types of Machine Learning**:
   - Supervised Learning: Learn from labeled data.
   - Unsupervised Learning: Discover patterns in unlabeled data.
   - Reinforcement Learning: Learn through trial and error.

4. **Common Machine Learning Algorithms**:
   - Linear Regression: Predict numeric values.
   - Decision Trees: Make decisions based on data.
   - K-Means Clustering: Group similar data points.
   - Neural Networks: Mimic human brain for complex tasks.

5. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.
